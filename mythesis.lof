\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.1}{\ignorespaces The right hand rule tells us which direction the currents will swirl around a vortex pointing into the page. Then using Lorentz's law at the second vortex, we can see that the second vortex will be pushed away. The same thing is happening from the current of the second vortex onto the first. Another way to see it is that in between the two vortices, the induced currents are cancelled out. Meanwhile on the outside of the vortices, the induced current adds up. The vortices will then feel a force which pushes them away from each other.}}{13}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.2}{\ignorespaces The right hand rule tells us which direction the currents will swirl around a vortex pointing into the page. Then using Lorentz's law at the second vortex, we can see that the second vortex will be pulled in this time. The same thing is happening from the current of the second vortex onto the first (although the second current flows in the opposite direction). In this case, the induced current between the vortices adds up while the current on the outsides cancels out. This makes the vortices move towards each other.}}{14}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.3}{\ignorespaces Vortices will be forced in many directions. These can be from the general current, from each other, or from regions of higher $T_c$. Looking at the equation for the order parameter free energy, one can see that it takes more energy to have a vortex in a region of higher $T_c$. The vortex will therefore feel a force away from the boundary with the stronger superconductor (darker red).}}{16}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.4}{\ignorespaces In blue is a sample current vs voltage plot for our system. In red is the "trigger" for this system. The trigger depends on what we are trying to show. Typically it was 1\% to 10\% of the full voltage at that current. Sometimes it was set at a constant small number just above the noise levels.}}{24}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.5}{\ignorespaces Overlapped are the current vs voltage for two systems, one with the current ramped up and one with the current ramped down. Upper one is the current being ramped down, while the lower one is the current ramped up.}}{24}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.6}{\ignorespaces This is a superposition of 100+ simulations with different parameters. The critical current of each simulation was shown using color. On the X-axis is the radius of each inclusion in the system. On the Y axis m is the ratio of number of vortices per inclusion. The colorbar stands for critical current. In other words, the redder a zone is, the better it holds on to vortices, the higher the current can be before the vortices begin to slip.}}{25}

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {B.1}{\ignorespaces This is a plot of the voltage (resistance) of the system as the current is slowly ramped up. At low currents, we just see the main vortex stuck to the Tc inclusion. As the current is increased, we eventually reach the depinning current and the vortices begin moving. This can be seen in the phase diagram as the phase has begun to wind up, indicating vortex movement. Sometime phenomena that can be observed, is that anti-vortex/vortex pairs are created in the inclusion and propagate in opposite directions. In region 3, the vortices clearly wind up the phase diagram and the resistance increases dramatically. Eventually in region 4, the system destabilizes and we begin to get vortex/anti-vortex pairs from the substrate. Finally, in region 5, we get full breakdown due to current and the system is no longer superconducting.}}{80}
