\section{GLconclusion}

To conclude, we have explored multiple systems with the use of the GL program. We showed that if the number of inclusions matches the number of vortices, the system jams and we have much lower resistance due to vortex motion. We have also explored many funnel systems which are currently being tried out experimentally throughout the superconduction community.
